Isn't it so convincing how that blade slide across my throat
Coke residue all in my nose
Couple graves dug for my foes and it goes on and on
My girlfriend calling my phone
Ain't seen her in about a week
This depression got me weak
Ever wake up every day and you want to die?
Life going good can't figure out why
Blank walls all around me keep the pills nearby
Player with the nine, then I close my eyes
